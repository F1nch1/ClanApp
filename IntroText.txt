Welcome to the Clan Creator, a game in which you take control of a leader and attempt to form a true clan from the
rag-tag cats of the forest. 

You've grown tired of your old life, and have decided to set out into the forest. What is it that brought you to this
point? Where did you come from?

[0]: I am a loner, having lived a life of solitude, moving between the wilds and the human lands as I so choose.
[1]: I am a housepet, growing up in the lap of luxury and never having felt the sting of hunger.
[2]: I am a stray. Once a housepet, my owners tossed me to the streets, leavng me to  scrounge for scraps.
[3]: I am a rouge, bullying others for what little food they have and fighting to defend my scant meals.
