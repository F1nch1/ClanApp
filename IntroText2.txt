The moon is full on the night that you decide to start your journey, giving you
a line of white light to guide your paws as you step away from home.
For the first time, you truly feel the grass crunch beneath your paws. 

Your head is filled with questions-- Where will you stay? Who will you find
to join you? All you truly know is that, once, your mother told you the story
of the great clans of old. Now, you wish to recreate those tales; to create
a paradise for felinekind, returning to the wilds from whence you came.

As you move, a scent washes over your tongue. You haven't eaten since sunhigh,
and it smells as though a mouse has crossed your path. You crouch down low.
You could certainly use something tasty to start your journey...
